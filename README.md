# "Fake" 2048

## Intro

A "fake" version of 2048. The only visual difference between this version with the real one is the animation. Implemented as a 2-D array, based on JavaScript.

## To play

Join the numbers and get to the 2048 tile! Use arrow keys (if on computer) to move all tiles together. Currently support only buttons for movements on cell phone.
